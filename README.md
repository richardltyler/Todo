# Todo
Places to go, people to see...

## Overview
Ok I know that I am far from the first person to build a todo app, but here me out: I actually built this one to use! I've had trouble keeping track of my tasks lately, and its about time I get a little organization skills. I need to write down my stuff, save it for later, and keep track of what tasks I have completed. Of course, I regularly jam my fingers into keys with reckless abandon, so I should also be able to edit the task. Then, I should be able to remove tasks as I go along. However, finding an app that does something so simple without ads, data tracking, and bloated features is proving more tedious than just custom making one. 

Fine, I'll do it myself. 🔹🌕🍅😈🩲☢️

## How to Use and/or Contribute

To add more features to this project, or to simply view the code in action...

1. Clone this repo (or first fork it and then clone) using `git clone [THIS REPO'S SSH KEY] [OPTIONAL DIRECTORY NAME]` inside of your terminal.  
2. `cd` into that directory.  
3. Install any necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Enter `npm run dev` to run the app on a local server or open the code in your text editor.  
5. The app should open automatically, but you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` as well.
